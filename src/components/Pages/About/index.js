    ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! <br />I combine creativity and technical skills to engineer
    dynamic projects. I'm a Web Developer, passionate about creating
    innovative and intuitive user experiences. I love the open-source culture.
    <span className="highlight">
      By participating in various Hackathons and winning various developer
      competitions, I learnt how to make great products with teams.
    </span>
    I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding creative solutions to tough
    problems. I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to be the best
    developer I can be, and I'm excited to bring my skills and expertise to your
    next project ðŸŒ± 
    <br/><br/>
    Outside of Programming, I run at the park and binge watch
    shows. World tour is the thing that excites me all the time.
